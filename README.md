🌸 Project Description – Love You More

The Love-You-More project is a small, creative, and romantic web-based application designed to express love in a fun and interactive way 💕. It’s built using a simple HTML file with animated assets (GIFs), creating an engaging and playful experience for the person who opens it.

At its core, this project is like a digital love letter, but instead of plain text, it uses animations, visuals, and interactive effects to make the message more emotional and lively 🌹✨.
